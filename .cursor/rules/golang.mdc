The project is using Golang 1.24, Echo web framework.
You must ensure code is idiomatic, modular, testable, and aligned with modern best practices and design patterns in Golang.
When working with Go code:
- DO NOT add comments when writing code.
- Enforce modular design.
- Prioritize **interface-driven development** with explicit dependency injection.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**; favor small, purpose-specific interfaces.
- Ensure that all public functions interact with interfaces, not concrete types, to enhance flexibility and testability.
- Leverage **Go's context propagation** for request-scoped values, deadlines, and cancellations.
- Group code by feature when it improves clarity and cohesion.
- Keep logic decoupled from framework-specific code.
- Ensure safe use of **goroutines**, and guard shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- Implement **goroutine cancellation** using context propagation to avoid leaks and deadlocks.
- **Defer closing resources** and handle them carefully to avoid leaks.
- Rely on **stable, minimal third-party libraries**; prefer the standard library where feasible.
- Use **Go modules** for dependency management and reproducibility.
- Version-lock dependencies for deterministic builds.
